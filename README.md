## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

There are lots to learn expecially when writing of JS codes. This was not a bit easy to phantom but all the same it worked well. One crucial lesson learnt is that it is harder to learn codes and easier to forget them when one does not practice for a long period of time.


### Continued development

Continued development would be in JS codes as I go along trying to carry more projects.

### Useful resources

A lot of resources was helpful not just in this project but from the beginning of my learning of web development.
